title: Contributing to Sui
---

This page describes how to add to Sui. If you merely need to get the Sui binaries, follow [Install Sui](../build/install.md).

Find answers to common questions in our [FAQ](../contribute/faq.md). Read other sub-pages in this section for ways to contribute to Sui.

## See our roadmap

Sui is evolving quickly. See our [roadmap](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/blob/main/ROADMAP.md) for the
overall status of Sui, including timelines for launching devnet, testnet, and mainnet.

## Join the community

To connect with the Sui community, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/sui).

## File issues

Report bugs and make feature requests in the [Sui GitHub](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/issues) repository
using the [Template for Reporting Issues](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/blob/main/ISSUES.md).

## Provide docs feedback

Send ideas to:
doc@mystenlabs.com

And file documentation fixes or requests for improvement at:
https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/issues/new/choose

Select the **Sui Doc Bug** template, adjust fields, and describe the issue.

You may also make changes to the docs directly in GitHub right here using the **Source Code** link below.

> **Important:** Make sure you are in the `main` rather than `devnet` branch in the URL.

Simply edit the file in question and generate a pull request. We will get back to you shortly.

## Download Sui

In order to obtain the Sui source code, follow the steps to download (`git clone`) the `sui` repository
at [Install Sui](../build/install.md#source-code).

> **Tip:** The install docs recommend use of the `devnet` branch as the last stable release. To instead
> contribute changes to Sui, use the `main` branch.

## Send pull requests

Start by creating your own fork of the repo:
```bash
$ gh repo fork https://github.com/mystenlabs/sui.git # or alternatively, clone your fork
cargo install --path sui/sui # put Sui CLI's in your PATH
cd sui
cargo build --all --all-targets # check that build works
cargo test # check that tests pass
```

To submit your pull request:

1. Make your changes in a descriptively named branch.
2. If you have added code that should be tested, add unit tests.
3. Ensure your code builds and passes the tests: `cargo test`
4. Make sure your code passes the linters and autoformatter: `cargo clippy --all --all-targets && cargo fmt --all`
5. If you have made changes to APIs, update the relevant documentation, and build and test the developer site.
6. Run `git push -f origin <branch_name>`, then open a pull request from the Sui GitHub site.
