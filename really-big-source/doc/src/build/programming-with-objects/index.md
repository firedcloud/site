title: Programming Objects Tutorial Series
---

Sui is a blockchain centered on [objects](../../build/objects.md). Once you start programming non-trivial [smart contracts](../../build/move.md) on Sui, you will start dealing with Sui objects in the code. Sui includes a rich, comprehensive library and testing framework to allow you interact with objects in a safe and yet flexible way.

In this tutorial series, we will walk through all the powerful ways to interact with objects in [Sui Move](../../learn/sui-move-diffs.md). At the end, we will also explore the designs of a few (close-to-)real-world examples to demonstrate the tradeoffs of using different object types and ownership relationships.

## Prerequisites

Understand:
- [Learn about Sui](../../learn/about-sui.md)
