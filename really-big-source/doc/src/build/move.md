title: Quickstart Smart Contracts with Move
---

Welcome to the Sui tutorial for building smart contracts with
the [Move](https://github.com/MystenLabs/awesome-move) language.
This tutorial provides a brief explanation of the Move language and
includes concrete examples to demonstrate how Move can be used in Sui.


## Move

Move is an open source language for writing safe smart contracts. It
was originally developed at Facebook to power the [Diem](https://github.com/diem/diem)
blockchain. However, Move was designed as a platform-agnostic language
to enable common libraries, tooling, and developer communities across
blockchains with vastly different data and execution models. [Sui](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/blob/main/README.md),
[0L](https://github.com/OLSF/libra), and
[Starcoin](https://github.com/starcoinorg/starcoin) are using Move,
and there are also plans to integrate the language in several upcoming
and existing platforms (e.g.,
[Celo](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210921006104/en/Celo-Sets-Sights-On-Becoming-Fastest-EVM-Chain-Through-Collaboration-With-Mysten-Labs)).


The Move language documentation is available in the
[Move GitHub](https://github.com/move-language/move) repository and includes a
[tutorial](https://github.com/move-language/move/blob/main/language/documentation/tutorial/README.md)
and a
[book](https://github.com/move-language/move/blob/main/language/documentation/book/src/SUMMARY.md)
describing language features in detail. These are invaluable resources
to deepen your understanding of the Move language but not strict prerequisites
to following the Sui tutorial, which we strived to make self-contained.
Further, Sui does differ in some ways from Move, which we explore here.

In Sui, Move is used to define, create and manage programmable Sui
[objects](objects.md) representing user-level assets.  Sui
imposes additional restrictions on the code that can be written in
Move, effectively using a subset of Move (a.k.a. *Sui Move*), which
makes certain parts of the original Move documentation not applicable
to smart contract development in Sui. Consequently, it's best to simply follow this tutorial
and relevant Move documentation links provided in the tutorial.

Before we look at the Move code included with Sui, let's talk briefly
about Move code organization, which applies both to code included with
Sui and the custom code written by the developers.


## Move code organization

The main unit of Move code organization (and distribution) is a
_package_. A package consists of a set of _modules_ defined in separate
files with the `.move` extension. These files include Move functions and
type definitions. A package must include the `Move.toml` manifest file
describing package configuration, for example package metadata or
package dependencies. See
[Move.toml](https://github.com/move-language/move/blob/main/language/documentation/book/src/packages.md#movetoml)
for more information about package manifest files.

The minimal package source directory structure looks as follows and
contains the manifest file and the `sources` subdirectory where one or
more module files are located:

```
my_move_package
├── Move.toml
├── sources
    ├── M1.move
```

See
[Package Layout and Manifest Syntax](https://github.com/move-language/move/blob/main/language/documentation/book/src/packages.md#package-layout-and-manifest-syntax)
for more information on package layout.

We are now ready to look at some Move code! You can either keep
reading for an introductory description of the main
Move language constructs or you can jump straight into the code by [writing a simple Move package](#writing-a-package), and checking out additional code [examples](../explore/examples.md).

## First look at Move source code

The Sui platform includes _framework_ Move code that is needed to
bootstrap Sui operations. In particular, Sui supports multiple
user-defined coin types, which are custom assets defined in the Move
language. Sui framework code contains the `Coin` module supporting
creation and management of custom coins. The `Coin` module is
located in the
[Coin.move](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/blob/main/crates/sui-framework/sources/Coin.move)
file. As you would expect, the manifest file describing how to build the
package containing the `Coin` module is located in the corresponding
[Move.toml](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/blob/main/crates/sui-framework/Move.toml)
file.

Let's see how module definition appears in the `Coin` module file:

```rust
module Sui::Coin {
...
}
```

(Let's not worry about the rest of the module contents for now; you can
read more about
[modules](https://github.com/move-language/move/blob/main/language/documentation/book/src/modules-and-scripts.md#modules)
in the Move book later.)

As we can see, when defining a module we specify the module name
(`Coin`), preceded by the name of the package where this module resides
(`Sui`). The combination of the package name and the module name
is used to uniquely identify a module in Move source code (e.g., to be
able to use if from other modules). The package name is globally
unique, but different packages can contain modules with the same name.
Module names are not unique, but combined with unique package name renders
a unique combination.

For example, if you have package "P" that has been published, you cannot
publish another package named "P". At the same time you can have module
"P1::M1", "P2::M1", and "P1::M2" but not another, say, "P1::M1" in the system
at the same time.

In addition to having a presence at the source code level, as we
discussed in [Move code organization](#move-code-organization), a
package in Sui is also a Sui object and must have a unique numeric
ID in addition to a unique name, which is assigned in the manifest
file:

```
[addresses]
Sui = "0x2"
```

### Move structs

The `Coin` module defines the `Coin` struct type that can be used to
represent different types of user-defined coins as Sui objects:

``` rust
struct Coin<phantom T> has key, store {
    id: VersionedID,
    value: u64
}
```

Move's struct type is similar to struct types defined in other
programming languages, such as C or C++, and contains a name and a set
of typed fields. In particular, struct fields can be of a primitive
type, such as an integer type, or of a struct type.

You can read more about
Move [primitive types](https://github.com/move-language/move/blob/main/language/documentation/book/src/SUMMARY.md#primitive-types)
and [structs](https://github.com/move-language/move/blob/main/language/documentation/book/src/structs-and-resources.md)
in the Move book.

In order for a Move struct type to define a Sui object type such as
`Coin`, its first field must be `id: VersionedID`, which is a
struct type defined in the
[ID module](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/blob/main/crates/sui-framework/sources/ID.move). The
Move struct type must
also have the `key` ability, which allows the object to be persisted
in Sui's global storage. Abilities of a Move struct are listed after
the `has` keyword in the struct definition, and their existence (or
lack thereof) helps enforcing various properties on a definition or on
instances of a given struct.

You can read more about struct
[abilities](https://github.com/move-language/move/blob/main/language/documentation/book/src/abilities.md)
in the Move book.

The reason that the `Coin` struct can represent different types of
coin is that the struct definition is parameterized with a type
parameter. When an instance of the `Coin` struct is created, it can
be passed an arbitrary concrete Move type (e.g. another struct type)
to distinguish different types of coins from one another.

Learn about Move type parameters known as
[generics](https://github.com/move-language/move/blob/main/language/documentation/book/src/generics.md)
and also about the optional
[phantom keyword](https://github.com/move-language/move/blob/main/language/documentation/book/src/generics.md#phantom-type-parameters))
at your leisure.

In particular, one type of custom coin already defined in Sui is
`Coin<SUI>`, which represents a token used to pay for Sui
computations (more generally known as _gas_) - in this case, the concrete type used to parameterize the
`Coin` struct is the `SUI` struct in the
[SUI module](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/blob/main/crates/sui-framework/sources/SUI.move):

``` rust
struct SUI has drop {}
```

We will show how to define and instantiate custom structs in the
section describing how to
[write a simple Move package](#writing-a-package).

### Move functions

Similarly to other popular programming languages, the main unit of
computation in Move is a function. Let us look at one of the simplest
functions defined in the
[Coin module](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/blob/main/crates/sui-framework/sources/Coin.move), that is
the `value` function.

``` rust
public fun value<T>(self: &Coin<T>): u64 {
    self.value
}
```

This _public_ function can be called by functions in other modules to
return the unsigned integer value currently stored in a given
instance of the `Coin` struct. Direct access to fields of a struct is
allowed only within the module defining a given struct as described in
[Privileged Struct Operations](https://github.com/move-language/move/blob/main/language/documentation/book/src/structs-and-resources.md#privileged-struct-operations).
The body of the function simply retrieves the `value` field from the
`Coin` struct instance parameter and returns it. Note that the
coin parameter is a read-only reference to the `Coin` struct instance,
indicated by the `&` preceding the parameter type. Move's type system
enforces an invariant that struct instance arguments passed by
read-only references (as opposed to mutable references) cannot be
modified in the body of a function.

You can read more about Move
[references](https://github.com/move-language/move/blob/main/language/documentation/book/src/references.md#references) in the Move book.

We will show how to call Move functions from other functions and how
to define the new ones in the section describing how to
[write a simple Move package](#writing-a-package).


In addition to functions callable from other functions, however, the
Sui flavor of the Move language also defines so called _entry
functions_ that can be called directly from Sui (e.g., from a Sui
wallet application that can be written in a different language) and
must satisfy a certain set of properties.

#### Entry functions

One of the basic operations in Sui is transfer of gas objects between
[addresses](https://github.com/move-language/move/blob/main/language/documentation/book/src/address.md)
representing individual users. And one of the
simplest entry functions is defined in the
[SUI module](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/blob/main/crates/sui-framework/sources/SUI.move)
to implement gas object transfer:

```rust
public(script) fun transfer(c: Coin::Coin<SUI>, recipient: address, _ctx: &mut TxContext) {
    ...
}
```

(Let's not worry about the function body
for now - since the function is part of Sui framework, you can trust
that it will do what it is intended to do.)

In general, an entry function, must satisfy the following properties:

- have `public(script)` visibility modifier
- have no return value
- (optional) have a mutable reference to an instance of the `TxContext` struct
  defined in the [TxContext module](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/blob/main/crates/sui-framework/sources/TxContext.move) as the last parameter

More concretely, the `transfer` function is public, has no return
value, and has three parameters:

- `c` - represents a gas object whose ownership is to be
  transferred
- `recipient` - the [address](https://github.com/move-language/move/blob/main/language/documentation/book/src/address.md)
   of the intended recipient
- `_ctx` - a mutable reference to an instance of the `TxContext`
  struct (in this particular case, this parameter is not actually used
  in the function's body as indicated by its name starting with `_`)
  - Note that since it is unused, the parameter could be removed. The mutable reference to the `TxContext` is optional for entry functions.

You can see how the `transfer` function is called from a sample Sui
wallet in [Calling Move code](wallet.md#calling-move-code).


## Writing a package

In order to build a Move package and run code defined in
this package, first [install Sui binaries](install.md#binaries) and
[clone the repository](install.md#source-code) as this tutorial assumes
you have the Sui repository source code in your current directory.

Refer to the code example developed for this tutorial in the
[M1.move](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/tree/main/sui_programmability/examples/move_tutorial/sources/M1.move) file.

The directory structure used in this tutorial should at the moment
look as follows (assuming Sui has been cloned to a directory called
"sui"):

```
current_directory
├── sui
```

For convenience, make sure the path to Sui binaries
(`~/.cargo/bin`), including the sui-move command used throughout
this tutorial, is part of your system path:

```
$ which sui-move
```

Now proceed to creating a package directory structure in the current
directory, parallel to the `sui` repository. It will contain an
empty manifest file and an empty module source file following the
[Move code organization](#move-code-organization)
described earlier.

So from the same directory containing the `sui` repository, run:

``` shell
$ mkdir -p my_move_package/sources
touch my_move_package/sources/M1.move
touch my_move_package/Move.toml
```

The directory structure should now be (please note that directories at the same indentation level in the figure below should also be at the same level in the file system):

```
current_directory
├── sui
├── my_move_package
    ├── Move.toml
    ├── sources
        ├── M1.move
```


Let us assume that our module is part of an implementation of a
fantasy game set in medieval times, where heroes roam the land slaying
beasts with their trusted swords to gain prizes. All of these entities
will be represented by Sui objects; in particular, we want a sword to
be an upgradable asset that can be shared between different players. A
sword asset can be defined similarly to another asset we are already
familiar with from our
[First look at Move source code](#first-look-at-move-source-code). That
is a `Coin` struct type.


Let us put the following module and struct
definitions in the `M1.move` file:

``` rust
module MyFirstPackage::M1 {
    use Sui::ID::VersionedID;

    struct Sword has key, store {
        id: VersionedID,
        magic: u64,
        strength: u64,
    }
}
```

Since we are developing a fantasy game, in addition to the mandatory
`id` field as well as `key` and `store` abilities (same as in the
`Coin` struct), our asset has both `magic` and `strength` fields
describing its respective attribute values. Please note that we need
to import the
[ID package](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/blob/main/crates/sui-framework/sources/ID.move) from
Sui framework to gain access to the `VersionedID` struct type defined
in this package.

If we want to access sword attributes from a different package, we
need to add accessor functions to our module similar to the `value`
function in the Coin package described in [Move
functions](#move-functions) (please make sure you add these functions,
and all the following code in this tutorial, in the scope of our
package - between curly braces starting and ending the package
definition):

``` rust
    public fun magic(self: &Sword): u64 {
        self.magic
    }

    public fun strength(self: &Sword): u64 {
        self.strength
    }
```

In order to build a package containing this simple module, we need to
put some required metadata into the `Move.toml` file, including package
name, package version, local dependency path to locate Sui framework
code, and package numeric ID, which must be `0x0` for user-defined modules
to facilitate [package publishing](wallet.md#publish-packages).

```
[package]
name = "MyFirstPackage"
version = "0.0.1"

[dependencies]
Sui = { local = "../../crates/sui-framework" }

[addresses]
MyFirstPackage = "0x0"
```

See the [Move.toml](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/blob/main/sui_programmability/examples/move_tutorial/Move.toml)
file used in our [end-to-end tutorial](../explore/tutorials.md) for an example.

Ensure you are in the `my_move_package` directory containing your package and build it:

``` shell
$ sui-move build
```

A successful build yields results resembling:

```shell
Build Successful
Artifacts path: "./build"
```

Now that we have designed our asset and its accessor functions, let us
test the code we have written.

## Testing a package

Sui includes support for the
[Move testing framework](https://github.com/move-language/move/blob/main/language/documentation/book/src/unit-testing.md)
that allows you to write unit tests to test Move code much like test
frameworks for other languages (e.g., the built-in
[Rust testing framework](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/testing/unit_testing.html)
or the [JUnit framework](https://junit.org/) for Java).

An individual Move unit test is encapsulated in a public function that
has no parameters, no return values, and has the `#[test]`
annotation. Such functions are executed by the testing framework
upon executing the following command (in the `my_move_package`
directory as per our running example):

``` shell
$ sui-move test
```

If you execute this command for the package created in the
[writing a simple package](#writing-a-package) section, you
will see the following output indicating, unsurprisingly,
that no tests have ran because we have not written any yet!

``` shell
BUILDING MoveStdlib
BUILDING Sui
BUILDING MyFirstPackage
Running Move unit tests
Test result: OK. Total tests: 0; passed: 0; failed: 0
```

Let us write a simple test function and insert it into the `M1.move`
file:

``` rust
    #[test]
    public fun test_sword_create() {
        use Sui::TxContext;

        // create a dummy TxContext for testing
        let ctx = TxContext::dummy();

        // create a sword
        let sword = Sword {
            id: TxContext::new_id(&mut ctx),
            magic: 42,
            strength: 7,
        };

        // check if accessor functions return correct values
        assert!(magic(&sword) == 42 && strength(&sword) == 7, 1);
    }
```

The code of the unit test function is largely self-explanatory - we
create a dummy instance of the `TxContext` struct needed to create
a unique identifier of our sword object, then create the sword itself,
and finally call its accessor functions to verify that they return
correct values. Note the dummy context is passed to the
`TxContext::new_id` function as a mutable reference argument (`&mut`),
and the sword itself is passed to its accessor functions as a
read-only reference argument.

Now that we have written a test, let's try to run the tests again:

``` shell
$ sui-move test
```

After running the test command, however, instead of a test result we
get a compilation error:

``` shell
error[E06001]: unused value without 'drop'
   ┌─ ./sources/M1.move:34:65
   │
 4 │       struct Sword has key, store {
   │              ----- To satisfy the constraint, the 'drop' ability would need to be added here
   ·
27 │           let sword = Sword {
   │               ----- The local variable 'sword' still contains a value. The value does not have the 'drop' ability and must be consumed before the function returns

   │                                                                   ^ Invalid return
```

This error message looks quite complicated, but it contains all the
information needed to understand what went wrong. What happened here
is that while writing the test, we accidentally stumbled upon one of
the Move language's safety features.

Remember the `Sword` struct represents a game asset
digitally mimicking a real-world item. At the same time, while a sword
in a real world cannot simply disappear (though it can be explicitly
destroyed), there is no such restriction on a digital one. In fact,
this is exactly what's happening in our test function - we create an
instance of a `Sword` struct that simply disappears at the end of the
function call. And this is the gist of the error message we are
seeing.

One of the solutions (as suggested in the message itself),
is to add the `drop` ability to the definition of the `Sword` struct,
which would allow instances of this struct to disappear (be
*dropped*). Arguably, being able to *drop* a valuable asset is not an
asset property we would like to have, so another solution to our
problem is to transfer ownership of the sword.

In order to get our test to work, we then add the following line to
the beginning of our testing function to import the
[Transfer module](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/blob/main/crates/sui-framework/sources/Transfer.move):

``` rust
        use Sui::Transfer;

```

We then use the `Transfer` module to transfer ownership of the sword
to a freshly created dummy address by adding the following lines to
the end of our test function:

``` rust
        // create a dummy address and transfer the sword
        let dummy_address = @0xCAFE;
        Transfer::transfer(sword, dummy_address);
```

We can now run the test command again and see that indeed a single
successful test has been run:

``` shell
BUILDING MoveStdlib
BUILDING Sui
BUILDING MyFirstPackage
Running Move unit tests
[ PASS    ] 0x0::M1::test_sword_create
Test result: OK. Total tests: 1; passed: 1; failed: 0
```

---
**Tip:**
If you want to run only a subset of the unit tests, you can filter by test name using the `--filter` option. Example:
```
$ sui-move test --filter sword
```
The above command will run all tests whose name contains "sword".
You can discover more testing options through:
```
$ sui-move test -h
```

---

### Sui-specific testing

The testing example we have seen so far is largely *pure Move* and has
little to do with Sui beyond using some Sui packages, such as
`Sui::TxContext` and `Sui::Transfer`. While this style of testing is
already very useful for developers writing Move code for Sui, they may
also want to test additional Sui-specific features. In particular, a
Move call in Sui is encapsulated in a Sui
[transaction](transactions.md),
and a developer may wish to test interactions between different
transactions within a single test (e.g. one transaction creating an
object and the other one transferring it).

Sui-specific testing is supported via the
[TestScenario module](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/blob/main/crates/sui-framework/sources/TestScenario.move)
that provides Sui-related testing functionality otherwise unavailable
in *pure Move* and its
[testing framework](https://github.com/move-language/move/blob/main/language/documentation/book/src/unit-testing.md).

The main concept in the `TestScenario` is a scenario that emulates a
series of Sui transactions, each executed by a (potentially) different
user. At a high level, a developer writing a test starts the first
transaction using the `TestScenario::begin` function that takes an
address of the user executing this transaction as the first and only
argument and returns an instance of the `Scenario` struct representing
a scenario.

An instance of the `Scenario` struct contains a
per-address object pool emulating Sui's object storage, with helper
functions provided to manipulate objects in the pool. Once the first
transaction is finished, subsequent transactions can be started using
the `TestScenario::next_tx` function that takes an instance of the
`Scenario` struct representing the current scenario and an address of
a (new) user as arguments.

Let us extend our running example with a multi-transaction test that
uses the `TestScenario` to test sword creation and transfer from the
point of view of a Sui developer. First, let us create
[entry functions](#entry-functions) callable from Sui that implement
sword creation and transfer and put them into the `M1.move` file:

``` rust
    public(script) fun sword_create(magic: u64, strength: u64, recipient: address, ctx: &mut TxContext) {
        use Sui::Transfer;
        use Sui::TxContext;
        // create a sword
        let sword = Sword {
            id: TxContext::new_id(ctx),
            magic: magic,
            strength: strength,
        };
        // transfer the sword
        Transfer::transfer(sword, recipient);
    }

    public(script) fun sword_transfer(sword: Sword, recipient: address, _ctx: &mut TxContext) {
        use Sui::Transfer;
        // transfer the sword
        Transfer::transfer(sword, recipient);
    }
```

The code of the new functions is self-explanatory and uses struct
creation and Sui-internal modules (`TxContext` and `Transfer`) in a
way similar to what we have seen in the previous sections. The
important part is for the entry functions to have correct signatures
as described [earlier](#entry-functions). In order for this code to
build, we need to add an additional import line at the module level
(as the first line in the module's main code block right before the
existing module-wide `ID` module import) to make the `TxContext`
struct available for function definitions:

``` rust
    use Sui::TxContext::TxContext;
```

We can now build the module extended with the new functions but still
have only one test defined. Let us change that by adding another test
function. Note that this function needs to have `public(script)`
visibility modifier to be able to call other functions with the same
modifier, such as our entry function `sword_create`.

``` rust
    #[test]
    public(script) fun test_sword_transactions() {
        use Sui::TestScenario;

        let admin = @0xABBA;
        let initial_owner = @0xCAFE;
        let final_owner = @0xFACE;

        // first transaction executed by admin
        let scenario = &mut TestScenario::begin(&admin);
        {
            // create the sword and transfer it to the initial owner
            sword_create(42, 7, initial_owner, TestScenario::ctx(scenario));
        };
        // second transaction executed by the initial sword owner
        TestScenario::next_tx(scenario, &initial_owner);
        {
            // extract the sword owned by the initial owner
            let sword = TestScenario::take_owned<Sword>(scenario);
            // transfer the sword to the final owner
            sword_transfer(sword, final_owner, TestScenario::ctx(scenario));
        };
        // third transaction executed by the final sword owner
        TestScenario::next_tx(scenario, &final_owner);
        {
            // extract the sword owned by the final owner
            let sword = TestScenario::take_owned<Sword>(scenario);
            // verify that the sword has expected properties
            assert!(magic(&sword) == 42 && strength(&sword) == 7, 1);
            // return the sword to the object pool (it cannot be simply "dropped")
            TestScenario::return_owned(scenario, sword)
        }
    }
```

Let us now dive into some details of the new testing function. The
first thing we do is to create some addresses that represent users
participating in the testing scenario. (We assume that we have one game
admin user and two regular users representing players.) We then create
a scenario by starting the first transaction on behalf of the admin
address that creates a sword and transfers its ownership to the
initial owner.

The second transaction is executed by the initial owner (passed as an
argument to the `TestScenario::next_tx` function) who then transfers
the sword it now owns to its final owner. Please note that in *pure
Move* we do not have the notion of Sui storage and, consequently, no
easy way for the emulated Sui transaction to retrieve it from
storage. This is where the `TestScenario` module comes to help - its
`take_owned` function makes an object of a given type (in this case
of type `Sword`) owned by an address executing the current transaction
available for manipulation by the Move code. (For now, we assume that
there is only one such object.) In this case, the object retrieved
from storage is transferred to another address.

The final transaction is executed by the final owner - it retrieves
the sword object from storage and checks if it has the expected
properties. Remember, as described in
[testing a package](#testing-a-package), in the *pure Move* testing
scenario, once an object is available in Move code (e.g., after its
created or, in this case, retrieved from emulated storage), it cannot simply
disappear.

In the *pure Move* testing function, we handled this problem
by transferring the sword object to the fake address. But the
`TestScenario` package gives us a more elegant solution, which is
closer to what happens when Move code is actually executed in the
context of Sui - we can simply return the sword to the object pool
using the `TestScenario::return_owned` function.

We can now run the test command again and see that we now have two
successful tests for our module:

``` shell
BUILDING MoveStdlib
BUILDING Sui
BUILDING MyFirstPackage
Running Move unit tests
[ PASS    ] 0x0::M1::test_sword_create
[ PASS    ] 0x0::M1::test_sword_transactions
Test result: OK. Total tests: 2; passed: 2; failed: 0
```

## Debugging a package
At the moment there isn't a yet debugger for Move. To help with debugging, however, you could use `Std::Debug` module to print out arbitrary value. To do so, first import the `Debug` module:
```
use Std::Debug;
```
Then in places where you want to print out a value `v`, regardless of its type, simply do:
```
Debug::print(&v);
```
or the following if v is already a reference:
```
Debug::print(v);
```
`Debug` module also provides a function to print out the current stacktrace:
```
Debug::print_stack_trace();
```
Alternatively, any call to `abort` or assertion failure will also print the stacktrace at the point of failure.

## Publishing a package

For functions in a Move package to actually be callable from Sui
(rather than for Sui execution scenario to be emulated), the package
has to be _published_ to Sui's [distributed ledger](../learn/how-sui-works.md)
where it is represented as a Sui object.

At this point, however, the
`sui-move` command does not support package publishing. In fact, it is
not clear if it even makes sense to accommodate package publishing,
which happens once per package creation, in the context of a unit
testing framework. Instead, one can use a sample Sui wallet to
[publish](wallet.md#publish-packages) Move code and to
[call](wallet.md#calling-move-code) it. See the
[wallet documentation](wallet.md) for a description of how
to publish the package we have [written](#writing-a-package) as as
part of this tutorial.

### Module initializers

There is, however, an important aspect of publishing packages that
affects Move code development in Sui - each module in a package can
include a special _initializer function_ that will be run at the
publication time. The goal of an initializer function is to
pre-initialize module-specific data (e.g., to create singleton
objects). The initializer function must have the following properties
in order to be executed at publication:

- name `init`
- single parameter of `&mut TxContext` type
- no return values
- private visibility

While the `sui-move` command does not support publishing explicitly,
we can still test module initializers using our testing framework -
one can simply dedicate the first transaction to executing the
initializer function. Let us use a concrete example to illustrate
this.

Continuing our fantasy game example, let's introduce a
concept of a forge that will be involved in the process of creating
swords - for starters let it keep track of how many swords have been
created. Let us define the `Forge` struct and a function returning the
number of created swords as follows and put into the `M1.move` file:

``` rust
    struct Forge has key, store {
        id: VersionedID,
        swords_created: u64,
    }

    public fun swords_created(self: &Forge): u64 {
        self.swords_created
    }
```

In order to keep track of the number of created swords we must
initialize the forge object and set its `sword_create` counts to 0.
And module initializer is the perfect place to do it:

``` rust
    // module initializer to be executed when this module is published
    fun init(ctx: &mut TxContext) {
        use Sui::Transfer;
        use Sui::TxContext;
        let admin = Forge {
            id: TxContext::new_id(ctx),
            swords_created: 0,
        };
        // transfer the forge object to the module/package publisher
        // (presumably the game admin)
        Transfer::transfer(admin, TxContext::sender(ctx));
    }
```

In order to use the forge, we need to modify the `sword_create`
function to take the forge as a parameter and to update the number of
created swords at the end of the function:

``` rust
    public(script) fun sword_create(forge: &mut Forge, magic: u64, strength: u64, recipient: address, ctx: &mut TxContext) {
        ...
        forge.swords_created = forge.swords_created + 1;
    }
```

We can now create a function to test the module initialization:

``` rust
    #[test]
    public fun test_module_init() {
        use Sui::TestScenario;

        // create test address representing game admin
        let admin = @0xABBA;

        // first transaction to emulate module initialization
        let scenario = &mut TestScenario::begin(&admin);
        {
            init(TestScenario::ctx(scenario));
        };
        // second transaction to check if the forge has been created
        // and has initial value of zero swords created
        TestScenario::next_tx(scenario, &admin);
        {
            // extract the Forge object
            let forge = TestScenario::take_owned<Forge>(scenario);
            // verify number of created swords
            assert!(swords_created(&forge) == 0, 1);
            // return the Forge object to the object pool
            TestScenario::return_owned(scenario, forge)
        }
    }

```

As we can see in the test function defined above, in the first
transaction we (explicitly) call the initializer, and in the next
transaction we check if the forge object has been created and properly
initialized.

If we try to run tests on the whole package at this point, we will
encounter compilation errors in the existing tests due to the
`sword_create` function signature change. We will leave the changes
required for the tests to run again as an exercise for the reader. The
entire source code for the package we have developed (with all the
tests properly adjusted) can be found in
[M1.move](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/tree/main/sui_programmability/examples/move_tutorial/sources/M1.move).

## Sui Move library
Sui provides a list of Move library functions that allows us to manipulate objects in Sui.

### Object ownership
Objects in Sui can have different ownership types. Specifically, they are:
- Exclusively owned by an account address.
- Exclusively owned by another object.
- Shared and immutable.
- Shared and mutable (work-in-progress).

#### Transfer to address
The [`Transfer`](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/blob/main/crates/sui-framework/sources/Transfer.move) module provides all the APIs needed to manipuate the ownership of objects.

The most common case is to transfer an object to an account address. For example, when a new object is created, it is typically transferred to an account address so that the address owns the object. To transfer an object `obj` to an account address `recipient`:
```
use Sui::Transfer;

Transfer::transfer(obj, recipient);
```
This call will fully consume the object, making it no longer accessible in the current transaction.
Once an account address owns an object, for any future use (either read or write) of this object, the signer of the transaction must be the owner of the object.

#### Transfer to object
We can also transfer an object to be owned by another object. Note that the ownership is only tracked in Sui. From Move's perspective, these two objects are still more or less independent, in that the child object isn't part of the parent object in terms of data store.
Once an object is owned by another object, it is required that for any such object referenced in the entry function, its owner must also be one of the argument objects. For instance, if we have a chain of ownership: account address `Addr1` owns object `a`, object `a` owns object `b`, and `b` owns object `c`, in order to use object `c` in a Move call, the entry function must also include both `b` and `a`, and the signer of the transaction must be `Addr1`, like this:
```
// signer of ctx is Addr1.
public(script) fun entry_function(a: &A, b: &B, c: &mut C, ctx: &mut TxContext);
```

A common pattern of object owning another object is to have a field in the parent object to track the ID of the child object. It is important to ensure that we keep such a field's value consistent with the actual ownership relationship. For example, we do not end up in a situation where the parent's child field contains an ID pointing to object A, while in fact the parent owns object B. To ensure the consistency, we defined a custom type called `ChildRef` to represent object ownership. Whenever an object is transferred to another object, a `ChildRef` instance is created to uniquely identify the ownership. The library implementation ensures that the `ChildRef` goes side-by-side with the child object so that we never lose track or mix up objects.
To transfer an object `obj` (whose owner is an account address) to another object `owner`:
```
Transfer::transfer_to_object(obj, &mut owner);
```
This function returns a `ChildRef` instance that cannot be dropped arbitrarily. It can be stored in the parent as a field.
Sometimes we need to set the child field of a parent while constructing it. In this case, we don't yet have a parent object to transfer into. In this case, we can call the `transfer_to_object_id` API. Example:
```
let parent_id = TxContext::new_id(ctx);
let child = Child { id: TxContext::new_id(ctx) };
let (parent_id, child_ref) = Transfer::transfer_to_object_id(child, parent_id);
let parent = Parent {
    id: parent_id,
    child: child_ref,
};
Transfer::transfer(parent, TxContext::sender(ctx));
```
To transfer an object `child` from one parent object to a new parent object `new_parent`, we can use the following API:
```
Transfer::transfer_child_to_object(child, child_ref, &mut new_parent);
```
Note that in this call, we must also have the `child_ref` to prove the original ownership. The call will return a new instance of `ChildRef` that the new parent can maintain.
To transfer an object `child` from an object to an account address `recipient`, we can use the following API:
```
Transfer::transfer_child_to_address(child, child_ref, recipient);
```
This call also requires to have the `child_ref` as proof of original ownership.
After this transfer, the object will be owned by `recipient`.

More examples of how objects can be transferred and owned can be found in
[ObjectOwner.move](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/blob/main/crates/sui-core/src/unit_tests/data/object_owner/sources/ObjectOwner.move).

#### Freeze an object
To make an object `obj` shared and immutable, one can call:
```
Transfer::freeze_object(obj);
```
After this call, `obj` becomes immutable which means it can never be mutated or deleted. This process is also irreversible: once an object is frozen, it will stay frozen forever. An immutable object can be used as reference by anyone in their Move call.

#### Share an object (experimental)
This feature is still in development. It only works in Move for demo purpose, and doesn't yet work in Sui.

To make an object `obj` shared and mutable, one can call:
```
Transfer::share_object(obj);
```
After this call, `obj` stays mutable, but becomes shared by everyone, i.e. anyone can send a transaction to mutate this object. However, such an object cannot be deleted, transferred or embedded in another object as a field.

Shared mutable object can be powerful in that it will make programming a lot simpler in many cases. However shared object is also more expensive to use: it requires a full sequencer (a.k.a. a consensus engine) to order the transactions that touch the shared object, which means longer latency/lower throughput and higher gas cost. One can see the difference of the two programming schemes between not using shared object vs using shared object by looking at the two different implementations of TicTacToe: [No Shared Object](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/blob/main/sui_programmability/examples/games/sources/TicTacToe.move) vs. [Shared Object](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/blob/main/sui_programmability/examples/games/sources/SharedTicTacToe.move).

### Transaction context
`TxContext` module provides a few important APIs that operate based on the current transaction context.

To create a new ID for a new object:
```
use Sui::TxContext;

// assmue `ctx` has type `&mut TxContext`.
let id = TxContext::new_id(ctx);
```

To obtain the current transaction sender's account address:
```
TxContext::sender(ctx)
```

## Next steps
Now that you are familiar with the Move language, as well as with how
to develop and test Move code, you are ready to start looking at and
playing with some larger
[examples](../explore/examples.md) of Move
programs, such as implementation of the tic-tac-toe game or a more
fleshed out variant of a fantasy game similar to the one we have been
developing during this tutorial.
