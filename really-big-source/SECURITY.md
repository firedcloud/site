# Security Policy

Sui is pre-release software under rapid development. It has not been audited and is not yet ready for production use.

When the Sui testnet is released, we will establish a responsible disclosure policy and a bug bounty program covering both [protocol security](doc/src/learn/sui-security.md) and software security. In the meantime, please report security problems via an ordinary github issue with the `security` tag.
