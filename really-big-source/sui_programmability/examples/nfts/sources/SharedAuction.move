/// This is an implementation of an English auction
/// (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_auction) using shared
/// objects. There are types of participants:
/// - owner - this is the original owner of an item that is sold at an
/// auction; the owner creates an auction and ends it the time of her
/// choice
/// - bidders - these are parties interested in purchasing items sold
/// at an auction; similarly to the owner they have access to the
/// auction object and can submit bids to change its state

/// A typical lifetime of an auction looks as follows:
/// - auction is created by the owner and shared with the bidders
/// - bidders submit bids to try out-biding one another
///   - if a submitted bid is higher than the current bid (initially
///   there is no bid), the auction is updated with the current bid
///   and funds representing previous highest bid are sent to the
///   original owner
///   - otherwise (bid is too low) the bidder's funds are sent back to
///   the bidder and the auction remains unchanged
/// - the owner eventually ends the auction
///   - if no bids were received, the item goes back to the owner
///   - otherwise the funds accumulated in the auction go to the owner
///   and the item goes to the bidder that won the auction
