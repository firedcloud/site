/// This is an implementation of an English auction
/// (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_auction) using single-owner
/// objects only. There are 3 types of parties participating in an
/// auction:
/// - auctioneer - this is a trusted party that runs the auction
/// - owner - this is the original owner of an item that is sold at an
/// auction; the owner submits a request to an auctioneer that runs
/// the auction
/// - bidders - these are parties interested in purchasing items sold
/// at an auction; they submit bids to an auctioneer to affect the
/// state of an auction
///
/// A typical lifetime of an auction looks as follows:
/// - auction starts by the owner sending an item to be sold along with
/// its own address to the auctioneer who creates and initializes an
/// auction
/// - bidders send bid to the auctioneer for a given auction
/// consisting of the funds they intend to use for the item's purchase
/// and their addresses
/// - the auctioneer periodically inspects the bids:
///   - if the inspected bid is higher than the current bid (initially
///   there is no bid), the auction is updated with the current bid
///   and funds representing previous highest bid are sent to the
///   original owner
///   - otherwise (bid is too low) the bidder's funds are sent back to
///   the bidder and the auction remains unchanged
/// - the auctioneer eventually ends the auction
///   - if no bids were received, the item goes back to the original owner
///   - otherwise the funds accumulated in the auction go to the
///   original owner and the item goes to the bidder that won the
///   auction
