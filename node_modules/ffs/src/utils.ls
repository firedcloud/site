### -- Dependencies ----------------------------------------------------
fs   = require 'fs'
path = require 'path'

pinky           = require 'pinky'
{lift-node}     = require 'pinky-for-fun'
{pipeline, all} = require 'pinky-combinators'


### -- Helpers ---------------------------------------------------------
list   = lift-node fs.readdir
status = lift-node fs.stat


### -- Recursiveness ---------------------------------------------------

#### Î» walk-tree
# Recursively applies a function to all nodes within a path.
#
# :: (String -> Promise a) -> String -> Promise [a]
walk-tree = (stepper, path-name) -->
  return (status path-name).then (info) ->
                                        | info.is-directory! => dive-in!
                                        | otherwise          => stepper path-name

  # keeps recursing through a directory.
  function dive-in()
    keep-stepping = walk-tree stepper
    files         = list path-name
    step-files    = -> files.then (xs) -> all (xs.map (keep-stepping . fix-path))
    return pipeline [ step-files, (-> stepper path-name) ]

  # adds the current relative path to the file name.
