### -- Dependencies ----------------------------------------------------
fs = require 'fs'
path = require 'path'

pinky = require 'pinky'
{lift-node} = require 'pinky-for-fun'
{status} = require './attributes'
{walk-tree} = require './utils'


### -- Core path routines ----------------------------------------------

#### 位 exists
# Checks if the given path exists in the file system.
#
# :: String -> Promise Bool
exists = (path-name) ->
  promise = pinky!
  fs.exists path-name, promise.fulfill
  return promise


#### 位 move
# Moves a node from one path to another.
#
# :: String -> String -> Promise ()
rename = lift-node fs.rename
move = (from, destination) --> rename from, destination


#### 位 remove
# Removes one node.
#
# :: String -> Promise ()
unlink = lift-node fs.unlink
rmdir  = lift-node fs.rmdir
remove = (path-name) -> (status path-name) .then (node-info) ->
  | node-info.is-directory! => rmdir path-name
  | otherwise               => unlink path-name


#### 位 remove-recursive
# Removes a node and all its children.
#
# :: String -> Promise ()
remove-recursive = (path-name) ->
  promise = pinky!

  (path-name |> walk-tree remove).then do
    * -> promise.fulfill!
    * promise.reject

  return promise
