-- Like function composition, but for promises
compose :: [Promise a b] -> Promise [a b]

-- Like compose, but left-to-right
pipeline :: [Promise a b] -> Promise [a b]

-- Resolved if all promises resolve
all :: [Promise a b] -> Promise [a b]

-- Resolved if any promise resolves
any :: [Promise a b] -> Promise a b
