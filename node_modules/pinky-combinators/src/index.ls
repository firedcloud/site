### -- Dependencies ----------------------------------------------------
pinky = require 'pinky'


### -- Composition combinators -----------------------------------------

#### 位 compose
# Like function composition, but for promises.
#
# :: [a | Promise a b] -> Promise a b
compose = (values) ->
  | values.length is 0 => pinky void
  | otherwise          => do
                          promise = pinky values.pop!!
                          i       = values.length

                          while i-- => promise = promise.then values[i]
                          return promise


#### 位 pipeline
# Like compose, but from left to right.
#
# :: [a | Promise a b] -> Promise [a] b
pipeline = compose . (.reverse!)


### -- Promise aggregation / parallelism -------------------------------

#### 位 all
# Returns a promise that is resolved when all other promises are.
#
# :: [a | Promise a b] -> Promise [a] b
all = (values) ->
  | values.length is 0 => return pinky []
  | otherwise          => do
                          result  = []
                          promise = pinky!
                          len     = values.length

                          values.map (a, i) -> (pinky a).then do
                            * fulfill-one i
                            * promise.reject

                          return promise

  function fulfill-one(index) => (value) ->
    result[index] = value
    if not --len => promise.fulfill result
    value


#### 位 any
# Returns a promise that is resolved if any is.
#
# :: [a | Promise a b] -> Promise a b
any = (values) ->
  | values.length is 0 => pinky void
  | otherwise          => do
                          promise = pinky!
                          values.map -> (pinky it).then do
                            * promise.fulfill
                            * promise.reject

                          return promise
